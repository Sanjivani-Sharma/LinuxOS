3/21:
    Video memory appeared with rainbow screen after enabling paging 
        Fix: pointed paging entry for video to the right address B8 + j
    Paging Disabled Error
        Fix: included paging.h file
    Infinite Bootloop for paging
        Fix: fixed video memory address indexing
    Initialized infinite pages
        Fix: stopped flushing after loading cr3

3/20:
    RTC printing only once
        Fix: inverted EOI bits to mask correctly
    RTC did not print anything (General protection exception)
        Fix: set master and slave masks at end of init_RTC

3/28:
    Text files would print perfectly fine but hello executable would only print first 6 characters
        Fix: Cause was due to '\0' characters following the 6 characters which C considered the end of the string and stopped copying and printing at that point
3/27:
    Page Fault error while trying to print directory
        Fix: Cause was due to faulty pointer/integer definitions that were all replaced to integers
3/24:
    Bug with keyboard where if backspace was clicked too many times terminal buffer would be empty even if keyboard buffer wasnt after reading
        Fix: Backspace was limited to only occur if x > 0 or if buffer occupies multiple lines and the current one is not the top.
    Bug with terminal where scrolling only scrolled half a line upwards each times
        Fix: the fault was because the bits were shifted to the right before scrolling instead of after scrolling. This caused the scrolling to only affect one buffer
    Bug with terminal where page fault error would occur after backspacing to top left characters
        Fix: limited backspace to stop at x = 0

4/11:
    Bug where execute would cause a bootloop on iret (2 Fixes):
        Fix part 1: realized that the shell c file was modified too much to the point where eip would jump to random sections of the code
            violating C calling convention and causing triple fault on return
        Fix part 2: realized that tss's esp0 was set incorrectly leading to the esp being wrong after iret causing a triple fault
    391OS> printed infinitely without the need for user intervention:
        Fix: fixed by adding a flag to the terminal_read function that only reads when enter is clicked (causes shell script to stall)
4/12:
    Bug where execute causes page fault when testprint is called:
        This was because when paging for the testprint process was done, it resets the entire stack to 0 which eliminates the return addresses
        pushed for return statements. 
        Fix: realized this was because tss was faulty and constant so altered the formula to change with process number
    Page fault when halting testprint
        Fix: realized this was because halt was called even after it was already halted because the process number still remained. Set the process
        number to the parent process number at the end of halt. 
    Stress test bug where testprint would pagefault after being called 6 times
        Fix: this was because the process_count was not decremented at halt leading to it forever increasing and maxing out at 6. This leads to 
        the execute function returning prematurely and causing a page fault

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
4/18:
    Bug where ls would fail when immediately executed after previous ls
        Fix: this was because when the verylarge... file was read by directory it would do so without \0 at end causing bug
    Sys error test would insert files into file descriptor array when close not open test called
        Fix: this was because open added to file descriptor array before checking if file is valid
    Alt would cause spaces
        Fix: limited displayable characters to only non \0 opens
4/17
    Vid map lays out fish in a wierd way
        Fix: realized this was because the characters in fish were printed in every other one order. This was because in filesystem,
        the variable that kept track of how far the file has been read so far was global. Due to this it would be incremented twice by
        the two frames leading to faulty display
    Vid map fails to animate fish
        Fix: dentry was global so it would read from the same file leading to on and off bits being the same hence not animating.

    terminal switching lead to page faults when switching screen
        Fix: Tested and found out that this would only occur after attempting to exit the base shell in parent terminal. This was fixed 
        by detecting bases for new terminals by counting the number of processes there are running. This allowed for the terminal to 
        not attempt quitting out of a shell that does not belong to it.
4/28
    Initial implementation of scheduling caused tripple fault (boot loop) when switching terminals
        Cause: After testing, it was realized that this was due to the general life cycle of the scheduler and a process. When the scheduler
        tries running a process that it has never interacted before (has not saved into pcb), it tries restoring the esp and ebp to the default
        C integers of 0 which cause kernel panic and bootloop
        Solution: Some flags were created to check if the respective terminal's base shell was executed yet or not. If it wasn't then the program
        does not restore the esp and ebp instead it executes shell so that the esp and ebp for the new terminal are automatically provided. This
        is now considered as initialized as now the scheduler can save the esp and ebp into the pcb for future use
    Terminal 2 would read from terminal 1 on enter occasionally and vice versa leading to this command does not exist
        Fix: this was fixed by changing the global read flag into an array for each terminal to indicate if the program should perform a read
        operation while also specifying which terminal to read from. 
    Terminals would read from and write to wrong pages after user input
        Fix: this was fixed by temporarily changing the mapping of the virutal video memory address to the hardware video memory address and then
        restoring the page table after the read/write operation was complete
4/30
    "391OS>" would disappear after fish was run
        Cause: this was because it was written to a different video page buffer instead of the current one.
        Fix: this was fixed by mapping two virtual addresses to the physical video memory address: they virtual video memory address and the 
        virtual vidmap address
